Education
======
* B.Sc-M.Sc in Physics, Institute of Technology Kharagpur 2007-2012
* Ph.D in Nuclear Physics, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2012-2020 

Research experience
======
* Research Assistant, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign
  * Ph.D. Thesis: “Measurement of high-mass dimuon production for p+p and p+d collisions with 120 GeV proton beam at Fermilab”
  * Conducted data extraction, transformation, loading (ETL), and quantitative analysis using MySQL, CERN-ROOT (C++) and FORTRAN.
  * Enhanced and maintained Monte Carlo C++ code for modeling signal and background.
  * Improved the simulation which led to a reliable method for separating signal from background.

* Research Intern, University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth
  * Utilized FORTRAN 90 codebase to conduct simulations for understanding the hydrodynamics of giant molecular clouds (acknowledged in the group’s publication)
  
* Research Intern, Raman Reserach Institute, Bangalore
  * Implemented MATLAB code to replicate findings of an astrophysics research paper on non-thermal Sunyaev–Zel'dovich effect in clusters of galaxies.
  
Machine learning side projects
======
* Pneumonia detection from chest x-rays using Convolutional Neural Networks
  * Processed NIH chest x-ray dataset of dicom x-ray files and radiological report attributes.
  * Implemented computer vision deep neural network architecture to classify x-rays.

* Statistical analysis of housing prices and recession across US locations
  * Performed cleaning, transformation, and merging of Zillow’s housing data, university towns from Wikipedia, and GDP data from the US department of commerce using Pandas.
  * Utilized hypothesis testing via t-test to identify effect of recession in housing prices in university towns. 

* Trolling, Aggression and Cyber-bullying Content Identification
  * Joint work with Sudhanshu Mishra and Shubhanshu Mishra
  * Used fine-tuning of multi-lingual transformer neural network with joint training training on different languages and joint labelling of multiple tasks.
  * Our approach came 2nd and 4th in 2 sub-tasks and 3rd in 4 of the 6 sub-tasks.
  * Code:  github.com/socialmediaie/TRAC2020
  
* Hate Speech Identification
  * Used fine-tuning of multi-lingual transformer neural networks, multi-task models and Back Translation.
  * Published in the Proceedings of the 11th annual meeting of the Forum for Information Retrieval Evaluation.
  * Extension of this work has been submitted to “Springer Nature Computer Science” journal.
  * Code:  [github.com/socialmediaie/MTML_HateSpeech]
