## Introduction

This project was a part of the final week assignment of an online course on Coursera on [Introduction to Data Science in Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data-analysis/). In general this course introduces the learners to various advanced Python features such asusage of lambda, list comprehension etc.. The course is very useful for getting familiar with pandas library and dataframe manipulation techniques. The final week of this course also covers statiscal analysis tools. This project is based on the final week programming assignment on hypotheis testing. The goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that the mean housing prices in university towns are less affected by recession as compared to mean housing prices in non-university towns. This requires running ttest on the ratio of mean housing prices before the start of recession to the minimum price during recession. 
There are 3 data files that are available:
  * List of university towns from wikipedia.
  * Housing data from Zillow containg information about house sale prices in each month from the year 1996 to 2016.
  * GDP over time data from Department of commerce.
