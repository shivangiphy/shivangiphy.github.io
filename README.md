Thanks for visiting my site ! A little bit about myself, I am currently a graduate student, pursuing doctoral degree in Nuclear Physics at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I am working on my thesis titled "Absolute cross section measurement from p+d & p+p Drell Yan measurement at SeaQuest". SeaQuest is a fixed target experiment located at FermiLab aimed at studying the substructure (specifically sea-quarks) inside nucleons. I joined the experiment in September 2013 and have been fortunate to learn a wide variety of skills while working on it. I have been actively involved in analysing large-scale dataset using MySQL, CERN-Root (scientific toolkit for processing large-scale data and statistical analysis) and Python.

In addition to learning more about the fundamental nature of everything in the universe, I spend time cooking, gardening and solving/creating puzzles.
