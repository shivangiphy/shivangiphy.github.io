Thanks for visiting my site ! A little bit about myself, I am currently a graduate student, pursuing doctoral degree in Nuclear Physics at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I am working on my thesis titled "Absolute cross section measurement from p+d & p+p Drell Yan measurement at SeaQuest" [1](https://npl.illinois.edu/news/story.asp?id=30736) [2](https://npl.illinois.edu/news/story.asp?id=28849). [SeaQuest](https://npl.illinois.edu/research/seaquest.asp) is a fixed target experiment located at [FermiLab](http://www.fnal.gov/) aimed at studying the substructure (specifically sea-quarks) inside nucleons. I joined the experiment in September 2013 and have been fortunate to learn a wide variety of skills while working on it. I have been actively involved in analysing large-scale dataset using MySQL, [CERN-Root (scientific toolkit for processing large-scale data and statistical analysis)](https://root.cern.ch/) and Python. One of the most significant aspect of data analysis that I have learned and enjoyed in my research is to stare at the data and ask critical questions about the various features it possesses and eventually figure out explanations for such features.

In addition to learning more about the fundamental nature of everything in the universe, I spend time cooking, gardening and solving/creating puzzles.
